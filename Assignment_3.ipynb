        "\n",
        "Stock price is the price of a single stock sold by a public company. Prices of stocks are changeable, since the demand and supply affect the price. If more buyers willing to buy stocks, the prices generally increase. If more sellers willing to sell the stocks, the prices generally decrease. In financial analysis, there are two methods of analysing stock prices. One method is technical analysis, and another method is fundamental analysis. Technical analysis focuses on the historical prices and market statistics. Fundamental analysis is the approach which concern about economic factors those affect the financial market. In recent years, with machine learning algorithms are being widely used in different sectors including the financial sector. In our project, we will also apply machine learning algorithms (LST & Sentiment analysis) to build the model are based on the technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Long-short term memory (LSTM) belongs to recurrent neural-network architecture. Recurrent neural-network is chain shape structure, looping back to the previous layers. The mechanism of LSTM is to enable the network to study tasks that depend on previous occurred events (Robert& Thomas,2018). To link to the stock prediction, we can apply LSTM model into technical analysis to study the pattern of stock historical prices. Sentiment analysis is a text mining method to determine the emotion or subjective feelings from source materials such as newspaper, website, or media sources, and judge the news have positive effect or negative effect (Shah,Isah & Farhana 2018). With the recent advances in deep learning, the ability of algorithms to analyse text has improved considerably. There are several types sentiment analysis. One famous type is intent analysis, it is used to analyse the user’s intention behind the message, which determine whether the message relates to market, opinion or politics. It can be applied if some who wants to analyse the stock price change with someone’s twitter message. Another type is contextual semantic search method, which extract some interesting things from the messages (Shashan,2018). There are several advantages in sentiment analysis. First advantage is scalability, sentiment analysis can process thousands of news, twitter messages in effective way. Another advantage is that real time analysis, we can use sentiment analysis to identify important information that allows situational awareness during specific scenarios in real-time. In our project, we will use fundamental analysis by applying the sentiment analysis to analyse the effect on stock by mining the subjective feeling from news text and predict the trend of stock price. This method generally predicts the stock price in long term. \n"

        "\n",
        "Financial prediction has never failed to attract investors’ attention. The successful analysis and prediction of stock trend or price means the successful investment for investors. Most current existing approaches of stock prediction by using machine learning algorithms is numerical analysis, which belongs to technical analysis. Even in some small-medium institutions, technical analysis is done by a group of analysts instead of one data scientist. Moreover, there is not much research about sentiment analysis about information. As we known, fundamental analysis is also important for stock trend prediction, since economic factors have bigger influence of stock price and trend in long term. For example, if Trunmp send a twitter about his opinion about US dollar value, the foreign exchangel market will be affected significantly by this twitter. However, the fundamental analysis and information reading work is generally done by human. Therefore, successful implementation of this project is the capstone of the implementation of sentiment analysis in fundamental analysis of stock prediction. On the other hand, investors will benefit from the successful investment by applying the model built. \n",

        "\n",
        "Before constructing the training set. Both the historical stock price dataset and news articles needs to be downloaded. For the convenience, we download the New York Stock Exchange stock prices dataset from Yahoo Finance.  However, to promote the accuracy of sentiment analysis, we need to collect information as much as possible. The dataset is composed of news articles and twitter messages from different websites such as Yahoo Finance.    \n",

        "2)\t Training set construction \n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "When we implement this project, we need use Python to build the models. And when we are building models, libraries are indispensable. For technical analysis, we need to build LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and there are some libraries imported from python as shown in the following figure. \n",

On the other hand, I expect that the chance of loss money will be reduced and the efficiency of prediction work will be improved.  Investors will benefit most from this successful project, with the successful prediction of stock price, they can have better trading strategies to have better investment return. Furthermore, can image that if this model is implemented successfully by one financial institution, the business performance of this financial institution will be improved significantly, and even perform better than other financial institution only focused on technical analysis. \n",

The average annual salary for financial analyst in Australia is AU$73,350, and average annual salary for data scientist is $119,936. The project runs 2 weeks, which is approximately 2 months. So, the salary during the project running for financial analysts and data scientists are $12225 and $19989.3. For data collection, all the data and news will be collected from Bloomberg, and one-month subscription is $9.99/month. The total budget for this project is $84437.9.  "
